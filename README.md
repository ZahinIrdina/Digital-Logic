Digital Logic 2024/2025

Throughout this course, I am able to utilize my knowledge in Boolean Algebra and number systems besides gaining new knowledge in logic gates and logic circuit design. Furthermore, I also gained valuable practical skills, such as implementing circuits during my lab test. I hope that more hands-on project will be conducted for this course as it will help students to understand better.
